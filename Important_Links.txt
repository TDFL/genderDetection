Train your model: 
1. Download this dataset:(Just copy and paste the link to download) https://github.com/arunponnusamy/gender-detection-keras/releases/download/v0.1/gender_dataset_face.zip
2. Install 2 more packages: pip install scikit-learn matplotlib
3. Start the training by running the command

$ python train.py -d <path-to-dataset>

(i.e) $ python train.py -d ~/Downloads/gender_dataset_face/

Depending on the hardware configuration of your system, the execution time will vary. On CPU, training will be slow. After the training, the model file will be saved in the current path as gender_detection.model.

If you have an Nvidia GPU, then you can install tensorflow-gpu package. It will make things run a lot faster.
